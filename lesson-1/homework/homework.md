# Lesson 1: Introduction to SQL Server and SSMS

Notes before doing the tasks: Tasks should be solved using SQL Server. It does not matter the solutions are uppercase or lowercase, which means case insensitive. Using alies names does not matter in scoring your work. It does not matter whether we close queries with ; or not

## Easy
1. Define the following terms: data, database, relational database, and table.
2. List five key features of SQL Server.
3. What are the different authentication modes available when connecting to SQL Server? (Give at least 2)

## Medium
4. Create a new database in SSMS named SchoolDB.
5. Write and execute a query to create a table called Students with columns: StudentID (INT, PRIMARY KEY), Name (VARCHAR(50)), Age (INT).
6. Describe the differences between SQL Server, SSMS, and SQL.

## Hard
7. Research and explain the different SQL commands: DQL, DML, DDL, DCL, TCL with examples.
8. Write a query to insert three records into the Students table.
9. Create a backup of your SchoolDB database and restore it. (write its steps to submit)
